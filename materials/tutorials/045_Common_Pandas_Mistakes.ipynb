    "The 'SettingWithCopyWarning' is one of the most commonly encountered problems for new users of Pandas. You will find many people asking about it online. As it is a warning, it is easy to ignore. However, it is important to understand what it means and how to fix your code when you see it because it means that you are doing something that is not guaranteed to work.\n",

    "This seems very natural, but it (probably) hasn't worked and it has generated a SettingWithCopyWarning.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the origins of the problem, it is necessary to understand that Pandas operations can return either a copy of the data or a view of the data. A copy is a new DataFrame that contains a completely new copy of the original data (or some part of it). A view is a new DataFrame that contains a reference to the original data (or some part of it). If you change the data in a copy, then the original data remains unchanged. If you change the data in a view, then the original data is also changed. (This is somewhat analogous to the difference between references and copies in Python variables, although Pandas’ internal data structures make the distinction more complex.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In our code above, the expression `df[df.name=='Bill']` has returned a **copy** of a slice of the DataFrame `df` and not a **view**. This means that when we use `[\"age\"] = 100` to set the age of Bill to 100, we are actually setting the age of Bill to 100 in a copy, and not in the original DataFrame. The original DataFrame is unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "The warning occurs because this code uses chained indexing — applying one index operation after another. Pandas cannot always tell whether the second operation modifies the original data or just a temporary object, so it raises a SettingWithCopyWarning to alert you.\n",

Whether or not the operation `df[df.name=='Bill']` returns a copy or a view is 'undetermined,'; in most current versions of Pandas, it usually returns a copy, but this behaviour is not consistent across versions and is not guaranteed. So, it is best not to ignore this warning *even if the code appears to work*. It tells you that you are doing something that is not guaranteed to work.\n",
