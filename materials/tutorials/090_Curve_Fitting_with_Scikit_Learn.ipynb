    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have been using the scikit-learn package to perform **classification** tasks. The other main task in machine learning is **regression**. Here we wish to predict the value of one or more **continuous variables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into the details, it is worth considering how classification and regression differ:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **classification task**, we need to predict a class label. The class label can be represented as **a discrete variable**, i.e., an integer. However, more significantly, the label is also often a **nominal value**, i.e., a value that does not have a natural ordering. For example, the class labels for the iris dataset, that we used earlier in the module, were `setosa`, `versicolor` and `virginica`. There is no natural ordering to these labels. We may have used the integers 0, 1 and 2 to represent these labels, but we could equally well have used the integers 2, 1 and 0. Integers are just a convenient way of representing labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **regression task**, we are predicting **a continuous value**. For example, we may want to predict the temperature for some given date in the future. Or, we may want to estimate some quantity that is hard to measure directly from a set of values that are more easily measured. For many problems the value being estimated will be a scalar value, i.e., a single value, but it could also be a vector. For example, we may wish to predict the position in space of a planet at some time in the future. In this case, we would be predicting a vector of three values, the $x$, $y$ and $z$ coordinates of the planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two important points to note about the above differences. First, unlike classification tasks, regression tasks do not have a fixed set of outcomes. This means that evaluation metrics such as percentage correct, and tools such as confusion matrices cannot be used. Second, for regression tasks, we can meaningfully talk about the 'closeness' of the predicted output to the true value (i.e., because the continuously valued outputs have a natural order.) So, we can evaluate the regression model by measuring the difference between the output and the true value. For example, we may use the mean squared error (MSE) or the mean absolute error (MAE). Note, that this idea of 'closeness' does not apply to classification tasks when the class labels are nominal values (if the true label is 'cat' then both 'dog' and 'duck' are equally wrong.).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will consider a particular type of regression problem, namely, fitting a curve through a set of data points. This is a visual task that will help us to understand the key concepts. We will then be able to apply these ideas to more general regression problems in later tutorials. Furthermore, to keep things simple, we will consider data points that are plotted along a single axes (i.e., one `independent variable`, for example, a plot of $y$ against $x$). However, keep in mind that the ideas that we develop here can be extended to data points that are plotted in two or more dimensions (i.e., fitting a surface to a plot of $z$ against $x$ and $y$).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Curve Fitting and Data Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting into specifics, it is worth spending some time to consider what we are really doing when we try to fit a curve through a set of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Curve fitting can be considered as a form of **data modelling**. We are drawing a curve in order to try and express a simple relationship between some input variable (i.e., the variable represented by the x axis) and an output value which is represented on the y axis.  For example, we may be trying to find the relationship between time and concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various reasons why we might want to fit a curve. We might want to **extrapolate** into the future or back into the past. We might also want to use the curve to **interpolate**, i.e., to estimate the value of y for some x for which we do not have a direct measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, we might want to use curve fitting as a way to understand the mechanisms driving the relationship between the input and output variables. For example, if the data can be fitted with a periodically varying function, then the duration of the oscillations may provide insight into the underlying mechanisms. Or, if we find that an exponential function fits the data, then this may give us some insight into the underlying processes; i.e., the growth rate being proportional to the current value tells us something about the mechanism that is driving the growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we fit a curve to some data? How will we decide which curve represents the best fit? What do we even mean by 'best'? These questions get to the heart of what we mean by 'modelling'. Obviously, we could draw some very wriggly line that goes precisely through all our measured data points and the curve would fit the measured data perfectly. In fact, there are an infinite number of wriggly lines that fit perfectly through any finite set of data points. All of these different curves would have different values if we interpolated or extrapolated. So, we need some way to choose between these, i.e., some precise way to say what we mean by 'best'. To do this we need to step back and consider the nature of the data that we are trying to model.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we model data, we work on the assumption that the output variable is made up of two components: **a deterministic component** and **a stochastic component**. The deterministic component is the part of the output variable that we can predict from the input variable. The stochastic component is the part of the output variable that we cannot predict, i.e. it is essentially random. Our model is an attempt to capture the deterministic component of the data. We will further assume that the deterministic component can be represented using a relatively simple function, and our job is to find the simplest function that captures this component accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the case of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. There is an underlying growth trend that comes from the burning of fossil fuels that drives the concentration upwards in a smooth way. In addition, there is also a seasonal variation due to the way that plants and trees absorb more carbon dioxide in the summer and less in winter. These two effects can be modelled with a curve that is controlled by a small number of parameters. For example, a parameterised quadratic curve to model the growth and a sinusoidal function with a parameterised amplitude to model the seasonal variation. However, if you look at the data, you will notice that the precise readings bounce up and down by a small amount every day. This is the stochastic component. It is not possible to predict these fluctuations from the input variable (time). They are due to all sorts of random fluctuations, e.g., fluctuations in the weather around the measurement station, and physical effects in the measurement instruments themselves. As we will see in this tutorial, because these random fluctuations behave very differently from the underlying trends, they do not prevent us estimating the trend parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the example above, we required some understanding of the problem to design a model. Our understanding led us to combine a smooth growth curve with a sinusoidal curve for seasonal variation. In general, because the space of possible 'models' is huge, this type of domain knowledge is essential to guide us to a good model. However, regardless of our understanding of the problem, our basic strategy is the same. We will start out with a very simple model, and then gradually make it more complex until we have a model that fits the data well. The aim will always be to find the simplest model that fits the data well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Some toy datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the ideas above, we will use some toy datasets. These data will not be from real problems, but will be artificially created by taking simple functions and then adding some random noise. This will allow us to easily evaluate how well the models perform because we will know the true function that generated the data. In the lab class, you will use the same techniques, but apply them to a real-world dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at two different types of data,\n",
    "\n",
    "- polynomial data, where the data are generated from a polynomial function, and\n",
    "- periodic data, where the data is generated from a periodic function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lab class, the data will require a model that combines polynomial and periodic functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with polynomial data. We will generate data for polynomials up to 4th order, i.e., linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic functions. We will use the following function to generate the data,"

The noise is drawn from a normal distribution, independently for each data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "For periodic data, we will consider functions that are constructed from the sums of sine and cosine functions. These functions will have terms $\\sin(Ax)$ and $\\cos(Bx)$ where $A$ and $B$ are integers. **Fourier Theory** tells us that any periodic function can be represented as a sum of sine and cosine functions in this way, if we use enough terms. To keep things simple, we will used functions with values of $A$ and $B$ in the range of 1 to 3.\n",

We will use the NumPy function `linspace` to generate the input values. This function generates a sequence of values between a start and end value. We will use the start value of -5 and the end value of 5 for the polynomials and a range of -10 to 10 for the periodic functions. The noise parameters have been tuned to add a small amount of random noise to the data, enough to make the estimation problem interesting but not so much that the deterministic component of the data is totally obscured."

It fits the noise in the training data as well as the underlying trend, producing a very wiggly curve that, while it may pass very close to the observed points, is unlikely to generalise well to new data.

    "## 6. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We have used scikit-learn's `LinearRegression` class to fit curves to data using models based on either a sum of powers of $x$ or on a sum of sine and cosine functions. The curves that we are predicting are not straight lines, but the technique for fitting them is **linear regression** because the parameters that we are estimating are linearly combined. We have seen that if we use a model that is too simple, we will **underfit** the data. The model will lack sufficient complexity to mirror the real data leading to poor estimates even in regions where we have observations (i.e., in regions of the $x$-axis that are close to observed points). Alternatively, if we use a model that is too complex, we will **overfit** the data. The model will be too sensitive to the noise in the data and will not generalise well to new data (i.e., we will not be able to **extrapolate** or **interpolate** well).\n",
    "\n",
    "It should also be noted, that successful fitting of the curve required having a good model in the first place. This is known as the **model selection** problem. For example, if our data are periodic in nature, then no polynomial model will ever be able to fit it well. Similarly, if the data is polynomial in nature, then no periodic model will ever be able to fit it well. In general, we need to have some understanding of how the data have been generated in order to be able to choose a good model. This is why **domain knowledge** is so important in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lab class we will be making a model that has a mixture of polynomial and periodic components to model concentrations of gases in the atmosphere. We will then use our model to make some simple predictions about the future. We will see that this sophisticated analysis is straightforward to achieve using the techniques that we have learnt in this tutorial.\n",
