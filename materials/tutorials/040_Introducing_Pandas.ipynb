    "\n",
    "### 1.1 What is Pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point, we have seen that Python’s built-in lists and dictionaries give us a lot of flexibility in how we process data, but this approach is slow and quickly becomes impractical when working with large datasets. NumPy provides a much more efficient alternative for handling numerical data, offering powerful tools for mathematical operations, linear algebra, and the kinds of matrix and vector computations that are common in machine learning. However, NumPy is less effective when we need to deal with more complex, structured data that might include a mix of numbers, text, categories, or missing values. This is where **Pandas** becomes useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pandas** is a third-party, open-source library that was created to meet the needs of data scientists. It builds on the speed of NumPy but adds a wide range of features for handling structured, table-like data, making it possible to work efficiently with datasets that resemble spreadsheets or database tables. While Pandas originally relied on NumPy as its foundation, NumPy was never designed with these kinds of tasks in mind, which led to some inefficiencies. To address this, the recent release of Pandas 2.0 introduced the option of replacing the NumPy backend with [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), a framework developed specifically for the fast and efficient processing of large, table-based datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is based on Pandas 2.3. The complete documentation can be found at [https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Installing Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "As Pandas is not part of the Python standard library, it must be installed before it can be used. This can be done easily using the `pip` package manager, or the `uv` environment manager that we are using with this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Pandas is not installed in your virtual environment, you can install it by typing the following command in your terminal."

    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Basic Pandas Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is designed for processing structured data much like the data that would be stored in a spreadsheet or a CSV file. Pandas organises data using two basic data structures: the **Series** and the **DataFrame**. A **Series** is a one-dimensional array of data that can be thought of as a single column in a spreadsheet. A **DataFrame** represents a table of data, which is represented as a collection of **Series** objects. A **DataFrame** can be thought of as being similar to an entire spreadsheet. Behind the scenes, Pandas stores this data in NumPy arrays by default, although, as we will see later, it can also be configured to use Apache Arrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has its own **type system** for representing data. This is largely the same as NumPy’s but extends it to handle additional types such as dates and intervals. Each Series (i.e., each column in a spreadsheet) has its own type, and different Series within the same DataFrame can use different types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond data storage, Pandas provides powerful tools for processing data. It supports operations such as filtering, joining, and grouping, as well as convenient methods for reading and writing data in many formats, including CSV, Excel, JSON, and SQL. Pandas also includes some basic data visualisation features, which are generally easier to use than the equivalent functionality in `Matplotlib`.\n",
    "\n",
    "n the remainder of this tutorial, we will build on these basic concepts step by step. In Section 2, we will look at how to read data from common file formats such as CSV and JSON. Section 3 introduces the DataFrame object in more detail and shows how to select, filter, and inspect data. In Section 4, we will see how to compute summary statistics and group data using the split–apply–combine approach. Section 5 explains how to deal with missing data, while Section 6 demonstrates how to merge and join data from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sections 7 and 8 cover more advanced topics that are not core to this module but are included for completeness. Section 7 introduces the new Apache Arrow backend, which provides faster and more memory-efficient data handling for large datasets. Section 8 shows how to read data from SQL databases — while we will not be working with SQL in this module, it is useful to know that Pandas can easily read data from database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Reading Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has a range of methods for reading data from different standard data formats. For example, it can read Excel spreadsheets directly with a simple `read_excel()` method. However, continuing from our previous tutorials, we will focus on the commonly used CSV and JSON formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Reading CSV Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading a CSV file with Pandas can be done with a single line of code:"

However, it is often more convenient and faster to use. If the DataFrame already has a meaningful index, then this is very easy to use; e.g., perhaps a product ID column is being used as the index and we have two DataFrames containing product sales for different product ranges that we wish to join.\n",

    "Comparing `merge` and `join`, `merge` is more versatile because it can merge on any column, whereas join can only merge on the index. So you might wonder why we have a `join` method at all? The answer is that the `join` method works internally in a very different way from `merge` that exploits special properties of the DataFrame index.

    "\n",
    "* **Faster operations** – many columnar operations (e.g., filtering, arithmetic) can be executed more efficiently on Arrow data.\n",
    "* **Smaller memory footprint** – Arrow uses compact, type-specific encodings and lightweight null bitmaps, reducing memory use for large DataFrames.\n",
    "* **True nullable types** – integers, booleans, and other types can natively represent missing values without falling back to slower object arrays.\n",
    "* **Better I/O performance** – Arrow-backed DataFrames read and write compact binary file formats like `Parquet` and `Feather` more quickly, often avoiding costly conversions.\n",
    "* **Cross-language interoperability** – Arrow is a standard across Python, R, Spark, and other systems, enabling zero-copy data sharing without duplication.\n",

    "Pandas is a large and sophisticated package for working with data. In this tutorial, we have used it to read data, to deal with missing values, to conditionally filter data, to compute statistics on fields with and without prior grouping, and to combine datasets using merge and join. This is a good overview of the most commonly used functionality, but only scratches the surface of what Pandas can do. There are entire books dedicated to Pandas and extensive documentation available online: it is a very useful tool to have in your toolbox. We will be using it throughout the rest of the module and will introduce new functionality as required.\n",
