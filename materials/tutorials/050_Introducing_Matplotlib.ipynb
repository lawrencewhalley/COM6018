    "* It is based on the plotting tools from MATLAB (hence the name).\n",
    "* It is extremely flexible - all aspects of plots can be controlled programmatically.\n",
    "* It can produce graphs, bar charts, scatter plots, contour and surface plots, etc.\n",
    "* It can produce very high-quality output in numerous formats (png, pdf, svg, etc.)\n",

    "\n",
    "Matplotlib and Seaborn are very large and sophisticated packages for visualising data in Python. Matplotlib works at a lower level than Seaborn. It is highly flexible and allows for very precise control but can be a little verbose, i.e., requiring quite a few lines of code to configure each plot. Seaborn is a higher-level package that is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a more convenient interface for common statistical plots. It interfaces elegantly with Pandas DataFrames and makes it very easy to generate plots that show the relationship between multiple variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn is very useful for initial data exploration where we are using plots to get a feel for the data and to identify interesting relationships. However, if we want to produce a publication-quality plot, we may need to use additional Matplotlib functionality to obtain the precise control that we need. e.g., to meet the style guidelines of a particular journal.\n",
