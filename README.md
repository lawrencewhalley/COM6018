## Welcome

This repository contains the teaching materials and other resources for the module COM6018 Data Science with Python, taught at the University of Sheffield. If you are taking this module please see the [module website](https://vle.shef.ac.uk/ultra/courses/_123512_1/cl/outline) for more information

You can install the materials on your laptop use by 'cloning' this repository. If you have not used git before then please see the instructions below in the section [Using Git](#using-git) below.

The materials in this repository are also available in Jupyter book format at [https://uos-com-6018.github.io/COM6018/](https://uos-com-6018.github.io/COM6018/). The Jupyter book is updated automatically when this repository is updated and so will show the latest version of the materials.

## Contents

The main contents of repository can be found in the `materials` directory. This contains the following subdirectories:

* `tutorials` - a set of jupyter notebooks covering the lecture material
* `lectures` - the markdown source for the lecture slides
* `labs` - the Jupyter notebooks used for the lab classes
* `solutions` - the solutions to the lab classes

## Using Git

If you have not used `git` before you may need to install it on your computer. The instructions depend on your operating system:

* **Linux**: For Debian/Ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install git` and for Fedora run `sudo dnf install git`.
* **MacOS** (e.g., MacBooks): Install the latest version from [this list](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/) by clicking on the link.
* **Windows**: Follow the instructions at <https://gitforwindows.org/>

## Setting up your local environment

First clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UOS-COM-6018/COM6018.git
```

Then make a virtual environment using `uv`.

If you don't have `uv` on your system, first install it following the instruction
here <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/>.

Then build the environment using

```bash
uv sync
```

Then to activate the environment, run

```bash
# For linux/mac
source .venv/bin/activate
```

or

```bash
# For Windows
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

You should now be able to open the `ipynb` files. For example, to open the first tutorial notebook, run:

```bash
jupyter notebook  materials/tutorials/010_Introducing_Python.ipynb
```

Note, this repository will be updated with new materials regularly throughout the semester. To synchronise your local copy with the master repository run the command:

```bash
git pull
```
